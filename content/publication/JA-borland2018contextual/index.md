abstract: Unseen information can lead to various “threats to validity” when analyzing complex datasets using visual tools, resulting in potentially biased findings. We enumerate sources of unseen information and argue that a new focus on contextual visualization methods is needed to inform users of these threats and to mitigate their effects.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Opinion paper advocating the need of contextual visualization for revealing potentially unseen data.
