Hi, my name is Wenyuan Wang, Wen for short. I am a Phd student at School of Information and Library Science, UNC Chapel Hill. My research interests include visualization systems, explainable AI and human machine teaming. My current thesis is on the differentiation of the concept of "enough" from both perspectives of a human and one's machine counterpart, in another word, how systems decide saturation and how humans define satisfaction, and what models could bridge such gaps.
